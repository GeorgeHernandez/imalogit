        <h2>Why and How</h2>

        <p>Many things are logged. One one end, the majority of logging is automated and handled by other systems. On the other end, there's specialized logging that varies from personal journals to videos and pictures and so on.</p>
        <p>Ima Log It is about common logging. In essence: logs with dated entries consisting of a number, a note, or both. You could do this in various ways: pen and paper, text file, spreadsheet, etc. These methods often work fine, but then you want more, but not too much.</p>
        <p>You want access from your phone. You want instant charts. You want access without having too much navigation. You want to export. You want the more important stuff (the signal) to pop out, while the less important stuff (the noise) to fade out. You want a sense of time. You want to compare two logs.</p>
        <p>And you want it all fast, simple, and easy.</p>

        <h2>The Logo</h2>

        <p><img class="img-fluid" src="/imalogit0150transparent.png" alt="Ima Log It"></p>
        <p>The logo has several basic elements.</p>
        <p>The simplest element is the cylindrical shape like that of log from a tree.</p>
        <p>That wood log ties in to the second element: The logging of events during the voyage of a ship. A floating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_log">chip log</a> with a rope with knots at regular intervals (i.e. a log-line) was used to estimate a ship's speed. The logo is the log-line reel with the knotted log-line peeling off of it.</p>
        <p>The third elment is that the log-line peeling off is plotted like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm">logarithm</a> base 2, where the knots are at the points (2, 1), (4, 2), and (8, 3).</p>
        <p>The fourth element is that the logo is like a smoking cannibis joint, which became legal in Illinois 2020-01, when imalogit.com was registered.</p>

        <h2>The Name</h2>

        <p>The first choice was Loggit (Logg.it) as a play on "dammit", but the domain name was taken.</p>
        <p>The name "Ima Log It" is essentially "I'm gonna log it" or "I'm going to log it", but short and casual.</p>
