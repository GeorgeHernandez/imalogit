        <h2>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</h2>

        <p>We only collect information that you voluntarily give us. There are typically three sets of info we have from you.</p>
        <p>One set is through direct contact such as email. Generally we will not contact you unless you contact us first. Possible exceptions include notifying you of changes to this privacy policy. In such a case we will probably contact you via email.</p>
        <p>Another set is sign-in info. If you sign-in directly to the site, then we only collect your name, email, and site-specific password. If you sign-in through a third party like Facebook, Google, or Amazon, then we have access to info like your name and email but NOT your third party password, your location, your files, etc.</p>
        <p>The last and largest set of info we collect is info you entered in our app for logs and log entries.</p>
        <p>In all three case we will not sell or rent this information to anyone. We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request. Otherwise we will not be looking at your info or mining it.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>

        <p>We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.</p>
        <p>Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page.</p>
        <p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (e.g. billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>
