# Ima Log It

Log stuff quickly.

The goal of this app is to allow users to quickly access logs, log entries, and see simple run-time charts. For more, see our [About Us](https://imalogit.com/about.html).

This code repository contains front-end code for the site, except the `Labmda` folder which has back-end code.
